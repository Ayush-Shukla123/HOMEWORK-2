<b><u><h1>HAMBURGER&#x1F354</h1></u></b>
<p>A Hamburger is a sandwich consisting of one or more cooked patties of ground meat,usually beaf,placed inside a sliced bread-roll or bun.The patty may be pan fried ,griled,smoked or flame broil.
Hamburgers are ofen served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon; condiments such as- ketch-up, mustard, mayonnaise.and are frequently, placed on sesame seed buns.
A Hamburger topped with cheese is called <i><b> Cheese Hamburger. </i>&#x1F354</b>
</p>
<p>It is one of the nastiest burgers out there. Adding cheese makes it more palatable, but it has a very strong taste of something nasty in amongst whatever they are calling MEAT. I honesty don't know 
ever sell one. </p>
